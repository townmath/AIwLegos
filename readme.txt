From the course site:
Challenge #1: Sense the environment in some way of your choice (light, temperature, sound, water level in your plant, etc.) and respond somehow. 

Challenge #2: Affect the environment in some way of your choice (move an object, make a robot drive or fly in a controlled way, turn an appliance on/off, or even just blink an LED). 

Challenge #3: Implement something pertaining to one of the lectures in hardware.
